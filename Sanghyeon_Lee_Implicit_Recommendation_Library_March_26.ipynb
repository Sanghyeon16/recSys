    "The Implicit Library is good for compareing various recommendation algorithms. Since the cutting-edge recommendation for implicit feedback datasets are implemented in the library, I could simply use and test their results. Even though the calculation time of ALS training function was slower than the one of ALS implementation without using the library function in my environment, the recommendation result was same which was very impressive. The library showed a benchmarks camparing the ALS fitting time versus Spark and QMF [7], but I counldn't cover this experience in my spotlight. Recommendation algorithms using implicit feedback data is used in many research fields. With no doubt, I would definitly use this library in the future for my research.\n",
